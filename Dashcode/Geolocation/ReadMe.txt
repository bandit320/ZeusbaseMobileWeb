DESCRIPTION:
Demonstrates how to create location-aware iPhone web applications using the GeoLocation API.
This sample displays a Google static map that shows the current location of a user. It also shows the latitude and longitude data associated with this location. The application updates the location as the user changes position. This sample illustrates how to register, update, and unregister for location change as well as how to handle location errors. See the "Getting Geographic Locations" section in the Safari Web Content Guide for more information about geographic location classes.
